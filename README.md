## Starting your project

> ❗️ Please make sure that you have installed the executable files for all the necessary tools before starting your project. Exactly:
>
> - `Air`: [https://github.com/air-verse/air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)
> - `Bun`: [https://github.com/oven-sh/bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun)
> - `Templ`: [https://github.com/a-h/templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ)
> - `golangci-lint`: [https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)

To start your project, run the **Gowebly** CLI command in your terminal:

```console
gowebly run
```

## Developing your project

The backend part is located in the `*.go` files in your project folder.

The `./templates` folder contains Templ templates that you can use in your frontend part. Also, the `./assets` folder contains the `styles.scss` (main styles) and `scripts.js` (main scripts) files.

The `./static` folder contains all the static files: icons, images, PWA (Progressive Web App) manifest and other builded/minified assets.

## Deploying your project

All deploy settings are located in the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files in your project folder.

To deploy your project to a remote server, follow these steps:

1. Go to your hosting/cloud provider and create a new VDS/VPS.
2. Update all OS packages on the server and install Docker, Docker Compose and Git packages.
3. Use `git clone` command to clone the repository with your project to the server and navigate to its folder.
4. Run the `docker-compose up` command to start your project on your server.

> ❗️ Don't forget to generate Go files from `*.templ` templates before run the `docker-compose up` command.

## About the Gowebly CLI

The [**Gowebly**](https://github.com/gowebly/gowebly) CLI is a next-generation CLI tool that makes it easy to create amazing web applications with **Go** on the backend, using **htmx**, **hyperscript** or **Alpine.js**, and the most popular **CSS frameworks** on the frontend.

It's highly recommended to start exploring the Gowebly CLI with short articles "[**What is Gowebly CLI?**](https://gowebly.org/getting-started)" and "[**How does it work?**](https://gowebly.org/getting-started/how-does-it-work)" to understand the basic principle and the main components built into the **Gowebly** CLI.
